    <h1>Keeping your dog in good shape</h1>

    <p>You bring your dog home from the grooming salon and they look so cute!  Their fur is soft, eyes are bright, breath is fresh and they just look picture perfect!  
        But now what?  How do you maintain this look for your fur baby?  They dont go back to the groomer for another 4 - 6 weeks.  You can't call the groomer to your house everyday.
        You can"t keep them in a glass box.  They need to eat, sleep and play.  </p>

    <p>Luckily, there are plenty of things you can do at home to maintain the cuteness of your little fur ball.  With a little time
        and effort, not only can you keep you pet looking nice longer, you can also form a closer bond with your baby!  So grab a pencil and
        a piece of paper to make a list of the things we need to succeed!  </p>
